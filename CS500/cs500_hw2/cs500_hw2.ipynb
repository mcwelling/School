    "\n",
    "In part a., you will draw an Entity Relationship (ER) diagram that defines entity sets and relationship sets needed to support the requested feature. The diagram must clearly specify primary keys for each entity sets and relationship sets. In addition, appropriate key constrains and participation constrains must be included with your design.\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT:** You do not need to add your drawing to this notebook! Take a picture of the ER diagram and submit the image to BbLearn as a separate file. \n",

    "### Requested Feature: Scheduling flights\n",
    "\n",
    "You are tasked to design relational schema that extends SQL tables `routes` and `airports` in `routes.v2.db` database. Your schema must support scheduling all flights defined in `routes` for a given date. In general, on a given date (e.g., '2019-01-21') one flight must be scheduled for every tuple (`Source`, `Destination`, `Airline`) in `routes` table. For this exercise we are only interested in scheduling flights for a 24 hours window. In other words, we do not need to schedule the time of flight's departure or arrival. In addition, we assume that any employee is available to service any flight unless the person is already scheduled to operate on another flight for that date, regardless of flight's `Source` or `Destination`. Similarly, any aircraft can service any route, as long as it is not scheduled for a different route on that date. \n",

    " * Passenger capacity is defined for each type of an aircraft. We assume that each aircraft type is operated by all airlines in the same configuration. Attribute `Equipment` specifies aircraft's type  (e.g., '738', '73W', 'CNC', etc). Attribute `Capacity` is an integer that specifies the number of passengers this aircraft can carry. In this exercise, we assume that there is only one (economy) class of seats in the aircraft. Also, your schema does not need to handle proper seat assignment for the passengers.\n",
    "   * `equipment_capacity(Equipment, Capacity)`\n",
    "      \n",
    " * Regular price of each ticket is defined by entity `airfare`. The final price of a ticket depends on the order in which a passenger booked the ticket (see below). \n",
    "   * `airfare(Airline, Source, Destination, Price)`\n",
    "\n",
    "* Airplanes that are operated by each airline are specified by entity `equipment`. Aircraft type is defined by the attribute `Equipment` (e.g., '738', '73W', 'CNC', etc). Attribute `EquipmentNo` is a serial number of a vessel that is owned by an airline (`Airline` attribute). \n",
    "   * ```equipment(EquipmentNo, Equipment, Airline)```\n",
    "\n",
    "* All airline employees are defined by entity `personnel`. Employee's name and position are defined by attributes `Name` and `Position`. Position can be 'pilot', 'attendant', or 'ground crew'. Attribute `Equipment` defines the type of an aircraft that employee is certified to fly or work on. We assume that an employee (regardless of their position) can be certified for only one type of an aircraft. \n",

    "\n",
    "#### Business Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional business rules are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* There is no limit on number of consecutive days an employee can work.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If `Source` airport has less than 25 inbound and outbound routes operated by any airline, then any flight between `Source` and `Destination` will only occur on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays. And flights from the `Source` city will be canceled on Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays, and Sundays. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Every flight must include 2 pilots, at least 3 attendants, and 5 ground crew members. If flight's capacity exceeds 100 person, you will need 1 attendant per 10 additional passengers. If an airline does not have enough free employees to operate a flight, it must be canceled. \n",
    "\n",
    "* `Equipment` attribute in table `routes` can specify multiple aircraft types that can operate on that route. If an airline does not have any free (i.e., not already scheduled for that date) aircraft that can fly a given route, this route must be canceled for that date.    \n",
